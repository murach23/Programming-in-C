##Aim of this project is to get out car from the carpark. During turn vehicle 
is allowed to move forwards or backwards one square. Once the front of vehicle touches 
exit, it is deemed to have exited the car park.
Brute-force algorithm is used for searching over all moves. There are two structs,
the first one stores information of each carpark and if it is unique adds to the end of the list.
Second struct stores information about each car.
To compile the code, firstly type "clang carpark.c -o carpark -lm" , then "./carpark 6x6.txt".

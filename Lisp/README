The project stores lists that can store other lists. To make that happen there is 
main struct that has two pointers. One car pointer that goes downwards and cdr that goes 
horizontally. 
Simple example of the list (1,2)
[*|*] - - - >[*|*] - - - > NIL
|             |
v             v
1             2
Some of the files were provided, I have written code for linked.c and specific.h. To compile the code
Makefile must be used.
